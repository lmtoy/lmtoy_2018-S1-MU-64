This project observed Sextans A searching for CO.   The known VLSR is 315 km/s, with HI emission
between 280 and 380 km/s. See e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07730.pdf

## OBSNUM

A total of 49 science obsnum's were taken in the CO line (115.3 GHz).
The good data were taken in a 4 night end sprint (March 12, 13, 18, 19) before Covid shut down the observatory.
Each dataset integrated a 120 arcsec region in OTF sthyle for about 600 seconds. Beams 0,5,12,13,14,15 were
often suspect. Individual inspection is needed. The final RMS in the combined map was about 21-23 mK, with no
clear CO detection.
